# Git Config
When first setting up Git, you'll need to work with the Git config in order to set up your identity.

For Example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name Kristen Gamelin
git config --global user.email kristengamelin@gmail.com
```
For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentaion.
