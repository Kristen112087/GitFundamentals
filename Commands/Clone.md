# Git Clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the rempte repository. It will be a clone, meaning is has all tracked [Commits](./Commit.md) and Commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `gitpull` command to pull updates from the original repository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElevenFiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
